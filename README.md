Breast Cancer Scikit Learn

I use the "Wisconsin Breast Cancer" which is preprocessed and cleaned dataset comes with scikit-learn. The target is to classify tumor as 'malignant' or 'benign' and code is written in Python using Jupyter notebook (BreastCancerLogisticRegretion.ipynb) and (BreastCancerKNN.ipynb) having implmentation of two different modules for the same dataset.

Techniques:

KNN
Logistic Regression

Steps to configure both the files:
1. git clone https://github.com/ayushi-desai/ayushi-lab2-2004.git, it will download the code at the desired location from where the command is treiggred.
2. open both ipynb files names one by one in jupyter notebook and run the code to run the models.
